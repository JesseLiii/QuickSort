# QuickSort
Quicksort program I made from scratch on Netbeans, that was a special assignment for me, 
on a harder level than the assignment most other classmates of mine got (Bubble sort, etc.). 

Uploaded from Netbeans

My level of proficiency is quite advanced, completing an AP Java computer science course. 

However, I'd like to learn more about CyberSecurity, Web Development and Entrepeuneriship.

If there are any skills that would increase my chances of an internship and benefit Avast more, feel free to email me
from my resume anytime, and I will learn those skills to the largest extent of my abilities.
